I like playing Wordle, but I get bored/annoyed if a game gets to the point where I've entered several guesses, and I know there's only a couple possible words that are valid guesses, I just can't think of them. There's some tipping point where some games stop feeling like I'm a human making fun decisions, and start feeling like I'm a dictionary trying to filter down to what words are legitimate guesses. And I'm not personally interested in being a dictionary... that's what computers are for.

SO: I did the fun human thing of writing a program to be a boring dictionary for me, and I called it Guessle.

Guessle doesn't make any attempt to suggest a good/smart guess - that's the fun human part I want to do - it JUST does the dictionary lookup to tell you what words are possible, based on the words you've guessed so far.

P.S. Guessle's `dictionary.txt` of 466k words was acquired from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words. I specifically chose to NOT use a dictionary of words known to be used by Wordle, because, again, Guessle's only job, for me, is to remove the burden of being a dictionary; not to play Wordle, or even really know anything about Wordle (Guessle just happens to let you look up words in a way that's helpful when playing Wordle).

P.P.S. There are surely more-efficient ways to do some of the search logic, but it's all going fast enough that my human brain doesn't notice, and this whole project is all about satisfying my human brain, so I'm good with that :P

P.P.P.S. my last name is not Guessle, but it is approximately as ridiculous.
